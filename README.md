# Project Title: Optimal Transport in Manifold Learning for Image Classification

* This repository examines the efficacy of optimal transport-based manifold learning algorithms versus traditional methods in supervised image classification tasks on datasets like MNIST and Fashion MNIST.

## Overview

* This project aims to assess the impact of manifold learning techniques on image classification performance.
  * **Definition of the tasks / challenge**: The challenge is to compare the effectiveness of traditional and optimal transport-based manifold learning methods in the dimensionality reduction of image datasets for improved classification.
  * **Your approach**: We apply manifold learning algorithms such as PCA, MDS, tSNE, and optimal transport-based Wassmap to transform image datasets, followed by classification using standard machine learning models.
  * **Summary of the performance achieved**: The comparison between manifold learning methods is quantified using visualization quality, stress evaluation, and classification accuracy metrics.
